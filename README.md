# K-MED-An-Algorithm-of-Uniform-Clustering-for-Efficient-Content-Based-Image-Retrieval
A new algorithm of uniform clustering for efficient content based image retrieval(CBIR).

Currently, search and retrieval of the relevant images efficiently from the huge amount of data is a challenging task for the researchers. Clustering is much useful in image segmentation to segregate a digital image into discrete regions that can be used to perform content-based image retrieval. In this paper, a new clustering algorithm named as K-MED clustering is proposed and implemented for performing uniform image clustering. It is compared with k-means clustering algorithm in some aspects and observed that the time complexity is reduced using this algorithm. The experimental analysis of K-MED clustering shows that some cases for the problem of local minima that arise in k-means clustering seem to be resolve. Proofs as the result of conducted experiments in controlled environment supporting the claim are provided with the material.
